HTML project for learning from The Odin Project

This is a site that links to three other sites that show recipes for their particular foods.

This was a basic project from The Odin Project to practice using HTML demonstrating the use of boilerplate HTML, headings, paragraphs, links to images and links, and lists.
Pretty basic, but good for learning purposes as well as my first foray into GitHub.

Recipes were pulled from allrecipes.com as well as recipetineats.com
